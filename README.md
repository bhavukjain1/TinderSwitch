# TinderSwitch
Get Tinder Plus Paid feature i.e Location Change for FREE on iOS. On iOS, manipulating GPS is not possible. So by using Tinder private APIs, we're manipulating the location of the User.

# Usage
Please follow these steps to successfully update the location:
1. Run the project on your real device (not simulator).
2. Do NOT open Tinder first. Open TinderSwitch, login with facebook(if not logged in) and select a location.
3. After the location is selected, click open Tinder which will open the Tinder app.
4. Go to settings on Tinder and change the maximum distance slider. Then click done. 

Now the new cards will start loading and you will see the people from the location that you have selected.
# Note
Once the location is updated by you, you will move to that location permanently until you change your location again, so you can get matches from the location that you have selected.

# Required
Always use TinderSwitch app first to change location before opening the Tinder app.

# Limitations
1. Location change between consecutive cities takes ~5 mins. If you try to change a location before that, you'll get an error "major position change not significant". So try after 5 mins.
2. You will need to update the maximum distance slider from Tinder settings everytime you select a new location, then only it will load new cards.

# 3rd Party Libraries Used:
1. Alamofire
2. GooglePlaces
3. Facebook

# All The Best
Hopefully, you'll enjoy using tinder plus feature for free and might find a match. :)
